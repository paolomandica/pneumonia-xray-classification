# Chest X-Ray Images Classification (Pneumonia)

In this project I'm going to train a CNN for the classication of Chest X-Ray Images of healty/pneumonia cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for the project is taken from the [Chest X-Ray Image (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) kaggle competition.

It consists of **5863 X-Ray images** (JPEG format) and 2 categories (**Pneumonia/Normal**), divided into:
- **train**: 1341 Normal, 3875 Pneumonia
- **test**: 234 Normal, 390 Pneumonia

## Files
- **main.ipynb**: notebook containing all the code for the completion of the project.
